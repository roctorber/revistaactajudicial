License
-------
This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3. See the file LICENSE for the complete terms of this license.

System Requirements

Installation
------------
Use the Plugin Gallery from within your PKP application to install the plugin. For further information refer to [PKP|DOCS](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/orcid/en/installation-setup).

Note
---------
In order to use the export into the ONIX4DOI XML format you will need to setup the plugin i.e. to enter the required information.
To register DOIs with mEDRA from within OJS you will have to enter your username and password.
If you do not enter or have your own username and password you'll still be able to export into the 
ONIX4DOI XML format but you cannot register your DOIs from within OJS.
Please note, that the passowrd will be saved as plain text, i.e. not encrypted, due to mEDRA registration service requirements.
To use the additional possibility to deposit the DOIs also with the Crossref, this mEDRA service will have to be enabled for your account.
If the automatic deposit option (in plugin settings) is selected, the mEDRA service to deposit the DOIs also with Crossref cannot be currently used.
